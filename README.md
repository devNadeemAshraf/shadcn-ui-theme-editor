# shadcn/ui Theme Editor

Currently you can test out different color schemes and see  how the app would look like and this app still requires some work. 

Please consider giving a star if you found this useful also I am open to contributions too, have an idea? want a feature? want to improve something? you are more than welcome!

Create some PRs and I'll be more than happy to merge them to the codebase.
